On joy2 and sorrow2
Kahlil Gibran

Your joy2 is your sorrow2 unmasked.
And the selfsame well from which your laughter rises was oftentimes filled with your tears.
And how else can it be?
The deeper that sorrow2 carves into your being, the more joy2 you can contain.
Is not the cup that holds your wine the very cup that was burned in the potter's oven?
And is not the lute that soothes your spirit, the very wood that was hollowed with knives?
When you are joy2ous, look deep into your heart and you shall find it is only that which has given you sorrow2 that is giving you joy2.
When you are sorrow2ful look again in your heart, and you shall see that in truth you are weeping for that which has been your delight. 

Some of you say, "joy2 is greater thar sorrow2," and others say, "Nay, sorrow2 is the greater."
But I say unto you, they are inseparable.
Together they come, and when one sits, alone with you at your board, remember that the other is asleep upon your bed. 

Verily you are suspended like scales between your sorrow2 and your joy2.
Only when you are empty are you at standstill and balanced.
When the treasure-keeper lifts you to weigh his gold and his silver, needs must your joy2 or your sorrow2 rise or fall.
